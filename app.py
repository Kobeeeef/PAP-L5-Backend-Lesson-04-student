# Exercise 1 
#
# Import sqlite3
# Import the display function from visualizer.py
# Create/Connect to the game.db database
# Get a cursor so you can write queries to the database
# Create a table called "scoreboard" with 3 columns:
# Round
# Player name
# Score
# make sure to check the table does not exist
# Run a SELECT query and show the output with the visualizer 
# to check that everything worked



# Write a INSERT query to add 4 players to the scoreboard table 
# Imagine you're playing your favorite game and all players are on Round (or level) 1
# Execute the query
# Create a SELECT query to retrieve the scoreboard table
# add a clause to show the highest score first, execute the query
# Check the output using the display function
# Run this file in the terminal and check the output on tables.html





# Exercise 2
# Write an UPDATE query to change Round to 2
# Execute the query
#Create a SELECT query to retrieve the scoreboard table showing the score from highest to lowest
# Execute the query and check the output using the display function
# Run this file in the terminal and check the output on tables.html




# Exercise 3
# Write an UPDATE query to put a different player in the lead.
# Execute the query
# Create a SELECT query to retrieve the scoreboard table showing the score from highest to lowest
# Execute the query and check the output using the display function
# Run this file in the terminal and check the output on tables.html



# Exercise 4
# Write a DELETE query to remove one of your players from the game
# Execute the query
# Create a SELECT query to retrieve the scoreboard table showing the score from highest to lowest
# Execute the query and check the output using the display function
# Run this file in the terminal and check the output on tables.html



# * Exercise 5 is in app_test.py *

# Exercise 6
# Commit your changes and close the connection to the database
# Run this file in the terminal
# Run app_test.py in the terminal and check the output with tables.html
